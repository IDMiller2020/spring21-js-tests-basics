// Dog Challenges

// Add the following properties to the dog object: name, legs, tail, and likes. 
// The name property should have a value that is a string, the legs property 
// should have a value that is a number, the tail property should have a 
// boolean value, and the likes property should have a value that is an 
// array.Inside the array, include at least 4 values.

// Write a function that uses bracket notation to change the cat's name from 
// "Pickles" to "Kevin".Then use either dot or bracket notation to return 
// the value of the name property.

  // your code inside here
  cat['name'] = 'Kevin'

// Create a function that uses dot or bracket notation to create a property 
// on the cat object called "color" and assign it to any color you'd like. 
// Then return the value of the color property.

function colorTheCat() {
  // your code inside here
  cat.color = 'brown'

// Delete the whiskers property off of the cat object. You may use either dot or bracket notation.

// value of the fourth item in the likes array("pets"). 
// Example: objectName.property[indexNumber]
